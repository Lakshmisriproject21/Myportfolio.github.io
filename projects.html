        <p><u>Title:</u>Diabetics Prediction By Using Machine Learning Techniques.</p>
        <p><u>Domain:</u>Machine Learning</p>
        <p><u>Abstract:</u></p>
        <p> Diabetes Mellitus is among critical diseases and lots of people are suffering from this disease.
            Age, obesity, lack of exercise, hereditary diabetes, living style, bad diet, high blood pressure, etc.
            can cause Diabetes Mellitus. People having diabetes have high risk of diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, eye problem, nerve damage, etc.
            In existing method, the classification and prediction accuracy is not so high. In this paper, we have proposed a diabetes prediction model for better classification of diabetes which includes few external factors responsible for diabetes along with regular factors like Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc.
            Classification accuracy is boosted with new dataset compared to existing dataset. Further with imposed a pipeline model for diabetes prediction intended towards improving the accuracy of classification.
